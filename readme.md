# Companion

# Getting Started <sup>(It's really easy)</sup>
## Dependencies
You will need to download and install Python.
### For Windows
I have created a file called [run.bat](https://github.com/lovesanxx/companion/blob/master/run.bat) and it downloads and installs any missing dependencies, then runs the bot. Use that instead, as it keeps your bot always updated.
### Otherwise
It's simple. Open a terminal anywhere, type the following command in, and hit enter:

`python -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]`

This bot uses the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library by [Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz). I also added some features to the bot that uses voice from the library, that's what the `[voice]` part at the end of the command is for.
## Running
After running the command (or batch file) in Dependencies, you can run `bot.py` from the terminal, like so:

`python bot.py`
