# Companion

# Getting Started <sup>(It's really easy)</sup>
## Dependencies
It's simple. Open a terminal anywhere, type the following command in, and hit enter:

`python -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]`

This bot uses the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library by [Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz). I also added some features to the bot that uses voice from the library, that's what the `[voice]` part at the end of the command is for.
## Running
After running the command in [Dependencies](), you can run `bot.py` from the terminal, like so:

`python bot.py`

**Or, you can execute the `run.bat` file if you're on Windows.** _(Highly recommended as it obtains required dependencies, if needed, automatically)_
